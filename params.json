{"name":"LitBackup","tagline":"Rock simple backup solution","body":"## Main advantages and unique features of Litbackup:\r\n\r\n* **blazingly fast** - 5 million files in under 5 minutes (depending on configuration)\r\n* **load balancing** - backup jobs and maintenance are running separately. You tell when.\r\n* **easy on disks** - large disks are slow, it uses them wisely\r\n* **very intuitive** - all backups are folders with dates\r\n* **adaptive** - just a few configuration options to start. Other are there if You need them.\r\n* **simple** - written in BASH, requires only \"rsync\" and \"find\"\r\n* **totally FREE** - released under GPL v3\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLitBackup mainly consists of two scripts:\r\n\r\n\"_backup.sh_\" - it is usually run during off-peak night hours. It looks\r\nfor changes in your server since the last backup and rsync's them. This\r\nis where the magic happens - it rsync's only the files which were\r\nmodified since the last backup. I have ran it on a busy shared hosting\r\nserver with ~5 million inodes 15k SAS -> 7.2K SATA and it took about 5\r\nminutes. Talk about speed!\r\n\r\n\"_rotate-backups.sh_\" - it creates hard links to save disk space. You\r\nsee a complete tree of files in each date. It removes old files to match\r\na set number of \"daily\", \"weekly\" and \"monthly\" backups. As an extra You\r\ncan easily configure it to gzip large and always changing files (I'm\r\nlooking at you, large databases and logs). And the most important aspect - it runs during the daytime, when the backup servers are idle!\r\n\r\nThere is also a set of neat options like full \"rsync\" parameter\r\ncustomization, excludes, includes, rotation day setup, compression and more. It was\r\ndone with many precautions in mind, to keep Your backups consistent and\r\nready.\r\n\r\n## What's next?\r\n\r\nRead the initial **[docs](https://github.com/administratorius/litbackup/blob/master/Documentation.txt)**\r\n\r\nDownload it from **[GitHub](https://github.com/administratorius/litbackup/tarball/master)**\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I am considering it almost production-ready, the standart\r\ndisclaimer applies:\r\n\r\n**I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, THESE BACKUP\r\nSCRIPTS MAY CAUSE YOU. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**\r\n\r\nLegal stuff aside - scripts have friendly comments, are small and easily\r\nreadable. I am very motivated to improve it and any suggestions and feature\r\nrequests are very appreciated via GitHub and: feedback at litbackup.eu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
