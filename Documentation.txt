This file contains info how to install, run and configure LitBackup. If
you are looking for an explanation what this is all about please see
"README.txt"


INSTALLATION STEPS

1.) Extract/git clone/download all "litbackup" files to a server

2.) Place all files at the exact locations as shown:

	"etc" - contains files to be placed in /etc
	"opt" - contains files to be placed in /opt (duh!)


3.) Use the directory "example-flavour" as a default flavour - the configuration set for a particular group of servers. Only simple characters allowed.

4.) Look through the configuration files in a flavour:
	4.1) "main.cfg" -  main configuration file. You will probably just leave default 
         values. The ones to change are: BACKUPROOT, DIRSTOBACKUP, SSH* and NUMOF*
         options.

	4.2) "backup-excludes.cfg" - rsync-style exclude list to ignore

	4.3) "no-recursion.cfg" - if some dirs are frequently changing you can add them 
	here to speed up rsync. Keep in mind that new files in these will be ignored. 
	Usually best for shared hosting, where dirs with 100s of domains or users force a 	full tree scan. 

5.) Add different flavours for each server group if necessary. Each group can contain it's own backup settings, SSH keys, etc.

6.) Edit /etc/litbackup/cron.cfg (all parameters explained in .cfg itself) 

7.) Edit /etc/litbackup/servers.cfg - add hostnames and specify flavours for each of them. If no flavour is specified the default one is used. Keep in mind that hostname is where rsync connects, so make sure it is resolvable or enter it's IP

6.) Add a cron job to run at 20 minutes intervals. You can run it as frequently as you like.

	*/20 * * * * root /opt/litbackup/cron.sh > /dev/null


That's it! During the first run the script will do a full rsync, so it may take
a while, but other runs will be very fast. The scripts are self-maintaining, so you don't
need to clean anything.
